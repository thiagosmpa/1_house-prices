## House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques
### Project #1

This project is part of the "100 Days to Get Hired" challenge. 
c
For my first project, I chose the well-known House Prices challenge on Kaggle. The tool used for the prediction will be autoGluon. 

**Project Goals** 

* Explore and understand the dataset provided.
* Apply feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.
* Utilize autoGluon to build and optimize a regression model.
* Submit predictions to Kaggle and evaluate the results.

**Dataset**
